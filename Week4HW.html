Currently I am working for Invention House LLC, an electrical engineering design bureau, where we design, assemble, and test motor control drives with military specifications. At this job I have acquired the following skills: reading schematics, testing products by using an oscilloscope and multimeter, and building testing fixtures to test individual products.  </p>
